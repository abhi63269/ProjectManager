This project focused on making a managerial portal for the employees of the company where they can track the records of their projects that they are currently working on, deadlines of the projects and summary in regard to the project. <br>I implemented Model View Controller(MVC) architecture to make the project and technologies used in the project were JAVA, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascipt, jQuery.
<br>In this repository, you can follow the path 'ProjectManager/src/java/' to have a look at the JAVA code which is divided into 3 main packages as per the implementation of the MVC architecture.
<br>Controller Package: This package contains all the servlets that handle the interactions between the web applications and the database.
<br>Model Package: This package contains all the business logic of the application.
